Cookport, WY 33980",Jackson-Guzman,575-74-7674,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Jackson-Guzman for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

    Corporate Tax Overview
    The corporate tax computation for Jackson-Guzman was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

    Key points include:

    Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 901 Austin Well Apt. 454
Cookport, WY 33980 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

    Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

    Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 575-74-7674 end with É??4567É??. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

    GST Compliance
    The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

    GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Jackson-GuzmanÉ??s manufacturing unit at 901 Austin Well Apt. 454
Cookport, WY 33980 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

    Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://www.moore-orozco.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

    Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 575-74-7674 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

    Withholding Tax (TDS)
    Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

    Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 575-74-7674, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in É??1234É?? due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

    Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Andrew Yoder was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

    Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 901 Austin Well Apt. 454
Cookport, WY 33980 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

    Audit Recommendations
    Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

    Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

    Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

    Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

    Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

    Conclusion
    We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Jackson-Guzman should review this report and initiate the necessary actions.

    Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
    Key Audit Matters AuditorsÉ?? response to Key Audit Matters
    Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
    There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
    We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
    Opinion
    We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Hogan, Smith and Galloway, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the CompanyÉ??s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 32836 Anthony Park Suite 592
Pollardton, IL 96104. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the É??ActÉ?ù) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
    Basis for opinion
    We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the AuditorsÉ?? Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (É??ICAIÉ?ù), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAIÉ??s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
    Key audit matters
    Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2396, 2445, 'address'), (18, 43, 'company'), (1812, 1837, 'company')]"
